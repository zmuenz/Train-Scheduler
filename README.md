# Train-Scheduler

* Add a train using the input on the page.

* The train will be added to the table and the next train arrival time will be calculated and displayed along with the minutes until that train arrives.

* I was having difficulty getting the frequency to show up correctly in the table, but I realized I didn't actually need to convert it to minutes for that part, and got it working.
